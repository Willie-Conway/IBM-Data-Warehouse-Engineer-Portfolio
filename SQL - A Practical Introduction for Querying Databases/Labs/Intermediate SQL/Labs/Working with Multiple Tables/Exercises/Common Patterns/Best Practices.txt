Best Practices

1 - Use explicit JOIN syntax for production code (more readable)

2 - Always qualify ambiguous column names

3 - Use meaningful table aliases (not just a, b, c)

4 - Test sub-queries independently before combining

5 - Consider EXISTS instead of IN for large datasets

6 - Add indexes on join columns for better performance
